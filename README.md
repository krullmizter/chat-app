### Node.js Chat app

This is a personal Node.js project to create a simple chat web app. This project is here to help me build upon my Javascript and node.js skills.

#### What's used

* Node.js
	* Nodemon
	* UUID
* Express.js
* Socket.io

#### Execution

The app uses Node.js to handle the back-end javascript. The Express.js framework takes care of running the web app on the web. Socket.io handles real-time input from the connected users and the server. This in turn lets you chat with another person via the browser just like WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger.

#### Test it 👨‍💻

At this time the project runs localy on the users system. To get started with this project just: 
- `git clone`
- Have node & npm installed.
- Run `npm i` in the root folder.
- Then run `npm run watch` to start nodemon.

Try running the app and open two separate tabs in your browser with the same URL as the app and see it working. 🚀
